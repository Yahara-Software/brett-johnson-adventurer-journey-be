# AdventurerPathAssessment

## Overview
You are an adventurer standing in the center of a map facing North, and youâ€™re trying to weave through the terrain to your final destination. You have the directions to your destination indicating the number of steps and the direction to travel.

The directions are provided as a string consisting of the number of steps first and the direction second. For example: 6F indicates 6 steps forward. 

Possible directions are:
- F for forward
- B for backward
- R for to the right
- L for to the left

This program will parse a string of directions and determine the Euclidean (straight line) distance from this starting point to the destination in steps.
